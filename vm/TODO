minimum needed to be "arduino" compatible:
* serial
* pin control (digitalWrite, digitalRead, analogRead, analogWrite, pinMode, etc)

* somehow build the vm with a compiled scheme program built in (this is
  the biggest hurdle, IMO)
  * building the compiler needs the vm to build successfully. here's one
    hackish way to do that:
    * build the vm with a dummy rom
    * replace the rom with the actual rom
    * build the vm again
  * https://github.com/kototama/picobit hardcodes the picobit ROM start
    address to 0x5000 and manually merges the picobit VM and compiled
    hex file together.
